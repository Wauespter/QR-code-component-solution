## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexible box
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The challenges overcome were mainly including a shading of the Title that represents the original project, preferring to use text-shadow instead of drop-shadow, the orientation of the frame and the image they were also a very good challenge, where I was able to understand how alignment with Auto Margin and ViewPort Width work.
The learning was extensive, I even had a better understanding of how to write a complete README.


### Continuous development
Constantly overcoming challenges is what motivates me, with each step, with each challenge overcome I feel fulfilled, I am continuing in search of new horizons.


### Useful resources

- [Text Shadow](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/text-shadow.pt_BR.html) - This helped me understand text shading features. I really liked this pattern and will use it from now on.
- [Drop Shadow ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow) - This is a more in-depth article for this functionality, I will study more about this theme. I recommend it to anyone learning this concept.
- [Align elements](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/2817/qual-a-melhor-forma-de-centralizar-um-elemento-vertical-e-horizontally) - For those who are still learning how to do it align elements, interact and share your knowledge
With the community it is very good to acquire new skills and techniques.
